st.markdown("In practice, it's often much easier to compute and visualize the graviational potential than it is the force; therefore, we can \
	start by computing the potential of a given mass distribution and use that to derive the force on an object in that potential.")

	using cylindrical coordinates. In this case, the Poisson equation becomes:")

st.markdown("#### Triaxial Systems")

st.markdown("Triaxial systems are found in elliptical galaxies. In general, they represent the most complicated systems, as they are not always \
	symmetrical in any of the three directions. Visually, triaxial distributions look like footballs.")

st.markdown("Solving and characterizing these systems analytically requires multipole expansions and Bessel functions; therefore, these will be too complex \
	to describe here. However, we include a page that allows the user to manipulate and experiment with this galaxy geometry.")
