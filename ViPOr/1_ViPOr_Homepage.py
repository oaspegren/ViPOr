# and how they relate to the motion and orbits of particles in galaxies

# overview of potentials
st.markdown("### Basic Information About Potentials")

st.markdown("Potential is the work per unit mass required to move an object from one point to another. In a gravitational field, this is the amount \
	of work done by gravity to move an object from infinity to a specific reference point.")

st.markdown("The force on a particle within a given mass distribution is related to the potential by the equation:")

	\bar{F}(\bar{x}) = -\bar{\nabla} \Phi
	''')
st.markdown(r"where $\Phi(\bar{x})$ is defined as")

st.latex(r'''
	\Phi(\bar{x}) = -G \int \frac{1}{|\bar{x}' - \bar{x}|} \rho (\bar{x'}) d^3 x'
	''')

st.markdown("A useful equation that relates force to density and potential is the **Poisson equation**, given by:")

st.latex(r'''
	\nabla \cdot \bar{F} = - \nabla^2 \Phi = -4 \pi G \rho(\bar{x})
	''')

st.markdown("In practice, it's often much easier to compute and visualize the graviational potential than it is the force; therefore, we can \
	start by computing the mass distribution, determining the potential and then taking the gradient to yield the force on a particle.")

st.markdown("Galaxy systems can be organized into three distinct categories, depending on their symmetries: :green[**spherically symmetric**], :green[**axisymmetric**] and :green[**triaxial**].")

# overview of spherically symmetric potentials
st.markdown("#### Spherically Symmetric Systems")

st.markdown("Spherically symmetric systems are exactly what they sound like: distributions that are symmetrical around any axis. These are simple to deal with \
	because of Newton's theorems. These state that an observer standing outside the distribution may treat the entire system as if the mass is concentrated at \
	the center of the sphere, effectively reducing the system to a point mass. The other states that an observer inside the sphere experiences no net force from \
	the shell of material beyond their position ‚Äî however, this material does affect the gravitational potential.")

st.markdown("The Poisson equation for spherical systems, which we use to relate the density of the distribution and the potential, is:")

st.latex(r"\nabla^2 \Phi (\bar{x}) = 4 \pi G \rho(\bar{x})")

st.markdown("Or, in spherical coordinates,")

st.latex(r"\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial r}) = 4 \pi G \rho(r)")

# overview of axisymmetric potentials
st.markdown("#### Axisymmetric Systems")

st.markdown("Axisymmetric systems represent galaxy disks, and are only symmetrical about their rotational axis. They can \
	either take the shape of oblate spheroids (which look like hamburgers) or prolate spheroids (which look like pickles). \
	Axisymmetric distributions are dealt with most easily using cylindrical coordinates. In this case, the Poisson equation becomes:")

st.latex(r"\nabla^2 \Phi (r, z) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial r}) + \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial z^2} = 4 \pi G \rho(r)")

# overview of triaxial potentials
st.markdown("#### Triaxial Systems")

st.markdown("Triaxial systems are found in elliptical galaxies. In general, they represent the most complicated systems, as they are not always \
	symmetrical in any of the three directions. Visually, triaxial distributions look like asymmetrical footballs.")

st.markdown("Solving and characterizing these systems analytically requires multipole expansions and Bessel functions; therefore, these will be too complex \
	to describe here with equations. However, we include a page that allows the user to manipulate and experiment with this galaxy geometry.")

st.markdown("Finally, we can determine orbits from potentials by employing Newton's 3rd Law.")
