# ViPOr: Visualizing and Plotting Potentials and Orbits (with Python)

ViPOr is a teaching tool to help understand the orbits of particles in different potentials. The package is a web application launched using streamlit. 

ViPOr makes extensive use of galpy, a Python package that includes features for initializing potentials, integrating orbits and displaying the paths of particles through multidimensional plots and animations.
